# plotly_deployment
Create an interactive data visualization using plotly.js

The full web application can be viewed here: [Deployed Plotly Web Application](https://jmueller187.github.io/plotly_deployment/)

## Overview of Project:
The purpose of this analysis was to create an interactive web page to summarize data compiled for Improbable Beef, who is looking to identify potential bacteria species candidates for the manufacture of synthetic beef. A list of Test Subject ID numbers was captured from the data and compiled into a drop-down list for the web page. By selecting an ID number from the list the following data for each test subject will be displayed:

1) Demographic information
2) The top 10 belly button bacteria cultures in a bar chart
3) Belly button washing frequency in a gauge chart
4) Bacteria cultures per sample in a bubble chart

Here is an example of the viewable data for Test Subject ID #940:
